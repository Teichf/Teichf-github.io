  <h1> Cassette Player </h1>
  
  
  <p> I am trying to make a cassette player that fits within an atloids tin.   </p>
  
  
  <p> I got this idea from my sophomore year working at Turn In Up! in Northhampton and having access to 25 cent cassettes and a cassette recorder in combination with my interest in, and studying in, electrical engineering.   </p>
    
  
  <p>So far in this project I have learned about PCB design, noise constraints and physical constraints.  This is also the first project with Fusion 360 and 3D printing.  I had some experiences going in but I really got a deep dive in learning about CAD modeling, slicing, printing and using different types of filament (PLA vs PETG) in this project.  </p>

  <p> I am currently wokring on the first prototype which consists of a simple circuit containing a LM386 mono audio amplifer and a NE555 motor control circuit </p>
  
  <p> For the mechanic parts I am designing the first prototype with just a tape loop set up with the motor acting as a capstan.  In next version(s) I would like to have a more complex real to real set up with a flywheel, clutch and motor pulleys and breaking mechanisms.  But for now I am just going to have a tape loop that can only play when powered. (no pause, ff or anything) </p>
