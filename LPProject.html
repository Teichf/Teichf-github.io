  <p> During my time at LaunchSpace, I designed several electrical engineering kits tailored to  makerspaces and its community. One example is a custom "Learn to Solder" kit, created specifically for LaunchSpace. The circuit is simple: press a button to turn an LED on or off. It includes a battery, battery holder, three switches, three LEDs, and three LED matched resistors.<p>

Here’s what one student said while using the kit:
“Wow, this is so relaxing—once you get the hang of it.”
