  <p> At LaunchSpace, we created games using GB Studio and then flashed them onto cartridges so we could play them on our Game Boy Colors.<p>
<p>
On a personal note, I’ve been very excited to get involved in gaming-adjacent projects because they’re a great addition to, and alignment with, my mission of making electronics fun, accessible, and engaging. GB Studio is a fantastic tool for this. It abstracts away a lot of the difficult coding, providing an approachable introduction and inspiration for people curious about programming and electronics. It’s a perfect entry point that can build confidence and spark intrinsic motivation to explore further, something I’m always passionate about supporting.
